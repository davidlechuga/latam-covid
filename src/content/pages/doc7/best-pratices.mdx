			Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water. Do this, for example, after paying for goods or touching surfaces like doorknobs. This also applies to other surfaces in public places.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Make sure you wash your hands at regular intervals, and for at least 20 seconds each time, with proper technique https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Why?</b> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

			Everyone is responsible to help reduce the intensity of this pandemic. Quarantines for people who have been exposed to the virus and isolation for those who are infected are necessary measures to contain the outbreak. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			General recommendations include: limiting the social events and gatherings you attend, and stay home if possible unless absolutely necessary.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Take notice: according to latest preliminary studies, about half of those who catch Covid-19 do so with absent to mild symptoms, meaning that asymptomatic individuals might contribute to the transmission of the disease in great numbers.

Coronantine has both compiled and ideated the following practices. Our aim and take, rather than create paranoia among the population, is to transit people’s criteria and decisions from the “fear stage” to the “growth stage”:
