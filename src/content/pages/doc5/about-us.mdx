Coronavirus has stricken humanity in unimaginable ways. We can already assure it will reshape society, economy, culture and politics. Coronavirus presents many challenges and opportunities at the same time: supply chains, communication, remote work, fake information and isolation (mental health). We are against the clock: Decisions and implementations must be chosen now.

Coronantine’s aim and take, rather than create paranoia among the population, is to transit people’s criteria and decisions from a “fear stage” to a “growth stage”. Coronantine’s objective is to teach people to think in terms of viruses, contagions and above all, how to take action and prevent further contagions.

Interactive, Social and Informative webpage about coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic made especially for those on quarantine. Coronantine.com addresses every aspect on coronavirus, providing official recommendations to share with our beloved ones and a place to gather socially and virtually during the quarantine. The webpage provides the reports of the generated anonymized data from the Coronantine Mobile App.

Most countries do not have the necessary measures to face coronavirus. Asian countries have managed to control the pandemic through mass testing, contact tracing, and travel bans, without significant economic shutdown. Contact tracing, although essential to control a pandemic, is painstaking, potentially missing several links who may continue to spread disease. Unidentified asymptomatic carries, may continue to transmit the infection. We propose an efficient and automatic way for doing contact tracing:

An open source privacy-oriented and automatic contact tracing app made to identify those who came into contact with an infected person. If a user sets their status to “presenting symptoms” or “diagnosed with COVID-19" the system traces contacts up to two weeks prior, sending them push notifications with official recommendations. The app also matches people through push notifications if a user's location crosses in close proximity with another that claims to have symptoms or is diagnosed. With enough information, this method could even identify non-symptomatic carriers.
